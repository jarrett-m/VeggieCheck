# VeggieCheck
Veggie Check is an app that allows users to scan USA food products to help determine if they are vegan or not.
Currently the back end is not ready to be open source, but it will be soon. Also note that there is no API key, yea I know it will be hard to test without haha I'll make one soon.

This was made using React Native + Expo
